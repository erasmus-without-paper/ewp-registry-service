Notes on contributing
=====================

Just some basic guidelines on reporting issues:

* If you have found a vulnerability, then please **contact a developer
  directly**. Avoid posting public threads on GitHub in such cases.

* In case of all other questions, feature requests and bugs unrelated to
  security, feel free to start a new issue yourself.
