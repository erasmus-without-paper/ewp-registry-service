                    ------------------

                    Every mobility has its unique sending-hei, receiving-hei and nominee, which
                    MUST NOT change after the mobility is created. For example, if it turns out
                    that a different student will be nominated for this mobility, then a new
                    omobility-id MUST be created for such nomination. However, the properties of
                    these mobility-related entities still MAY change. E.g. the student's name may
                    get updated.

                        Most mobilities take place (or are supposed to take place) during a single
                        academic term (or part of such single term). The sending HEI is REQUIRED to
                        either identify this term, or to clearly state that the sending mobility period
                        is "non-standard", and is not contained by any single academic term.

                        This information needs to be provided "from the start" (when a new nomination is
                        created).

                        For more information, read this thread:

                            If this element is present, then the sending HEI states that the mobility is
                            supposed to take place *during* the academic term identified here.

                            "During" doesn't imply that it will take place over the *entire* period of the
                            academic term. However, it's also RECOMMENDED to supply the *smallest* academic
                            term within which the mobility period fits into (i.e. the use of an academic
                            year should be avoided if a semester is sufficient). See here:
                            https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-api-omobilities/pull/30#discussion_r159843983

                            Note that sending and receiving HEIs MAY use different academic term
                            identifiers (e.g. "2022/2023-1/2" might be equal to "2022/2022-2/2"). This
                            particular identifier is the term identifier at the *sending* HEI, not the
                            receiving HEI.

                            If this element is present, then the sending HEI states that the mobility is
                            supposed to take place outside the bounds of any standard academic term. E.g.
                            during the summer vacations.

                            This element is currently empty, but this MAY change in the future. Clients
                            MUST be ready for that (and treat such non-empty element as if it was empty).

                        Academic year during which this mobility takes place (or is supposed to take
                        place).

                        Note, that sending and receiving HEIs MAY use different academic year
                        identifiers (e.g. "2022/2023" vs. "2022/2022" or "2023/2023"). This
                        particular identifier is the year identifier at the *receiving* HEI, not the
                        sending HEI.

                        This means that the sending HEI MUST know how the receiving HEI identifies its
                        academic years (i.e. whether it lies on the northern or southern hemisphere),
                        and be able to match its mobilities with these identifiers.

                        above the limit defined in the IIA cooperation conditions,

                        and is in the first year of second-cycle studies.
                        Since in your country the bachelor's degree is four years,
                        the student should go to first-cycle studies.

                        These comments MUST be visible only to the IRO members, not the students.

                        It is left unspecified how servers should handle these comments - e.g.,
                        they may store them along their mobilities, or they may forward them to specific persons, etc.
