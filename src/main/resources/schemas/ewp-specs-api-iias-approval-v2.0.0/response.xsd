                            This element represents a single IIA approval. 
                            For each of the `iia_id` values passed in the API call, server will produce one such
                            element if and only if the corresponding agreement
                            (more precisely: partner's copy of the agreement) is approved by him.

                            <xs:element name="iia-hash" type="ewp:Sha256Hex">
                                <xs:annotation>
                                    <xs:documentation>
                                        The SHA-256 digest of the `text-to-hash` element content that is obtained
                                        by using the appropriate XSLT transformation mentioned in the API specification.

                                        The digest is present in the IIAs API get response, but MUST be verified by the server
                                        before sending the approval. For this purpose, the server has to call the IIAs get API
                                        and compare the hash received in the response with the hash independently calculated
                                        from that response. If both hashes are identical,
                                        the agreement can be approved.

                                        Note: Server does not perform above mentioned hash verification as a result of
                                        IIAs Approval get request. It MUST be done before and stored locally on the server
                                        (and announced with CNR).

                                        Identifier of the file containing the PDF version of the agreement.
                                        This SHOULD be the PDF that was fetched from the partner via the IIA API,
                                        additionally signed by the approving partner.

                                        The file MUST be accessible to the receiving HEI through the EWP File API.

                                        Notes for client implementers:

                                        For security reasons, you may consider checking the content type of the file
                                        before displaying it in the browser.
