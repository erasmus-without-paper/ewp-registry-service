                The sending HEI, on whose servers the mobility object is stored, MAY allow for

                            If the contents of `current-latest-draft-snapshot` don't match the current
                            values as kept in the server's database, then the server MUST respond with

                            * Error response SHOULD include the `user-message` element with a brief
                              explanation (e.g. "Your copy of the Learning Agreement is not up-to-date. We

                            It might seem redundant because it can be generated automatically from the
                            other two. It is required however - to prove consistency. We want both parties
                            to be sure that they generate changes and snapshots properly.

                            If the server detects that the snapshot calculated by the client is different
                            than a similar snapshot calculated by the server, then it MUST respond with an
                            either HTTP 400 error. At this point, both parties should review their snapshot
                            generation algorithms.
