                            This represents a single IIA. Servers will produce one such element for
                            each of the `iia_id` values passed in the Institutions API call.

                                        This is the *local* ID of this IIA. It is always equal to one of the values
                                        passed in the `iia_id` request parameter.

                                        "Local ID" means the IIA ID used by the HEI referred to in the `hei_id` request
                                        parameter.

                                        to this IIA).

                                        Not all servers provide these! Many HEIs (especially the smaller ones) don't
                                        granulate their contacts in such a detailed way. Instead, they have a fixed set
                                        of contacts described in their Institutions API.

                                        These contacts take precedence over contacts defined in the Institutions API.
                                        Clients are advised to display these contacts in a separate section above other
                                        contacts - so that the users will notice them first (before scrolling down to
                                        other, more generic contacts).

                                                    Since IIA IDs are local (unique within a single HEI, but not within the world),
                                                    each partner is allowed to have his own ID for the same IIA. If this server is
                                                    aware of the IDs used by the other partners, then it outputs it here.

    <xs:complexType name="MobilitySpecification" abstract="true">
        <xs:annotation>
            <xs:documentation>
                A common parent class for all mobility specifications.

                Note that "mobility specification" is a name we (EWP designers) made up. We
                needed to have a descriptive name for this particular entity, and we couldn't
                find such name in existing Erasmus+ templates. In other words, this is an
                EWP-specific term only, and you should probably avoid using it in other
                contexts.

                Mobility specification may also be considered as a subclass of "cooperation
                condition", but - since currently all nonabstract subclasses inherit from
                MobilitySpecification - no CooperationCondition class is introduced. See here:
                https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-wp3-data-model/issues/10

                Each specification has a sending and receiving partner. Each specification
                represents an agreement that, for each of the academic years listed within, the
                sending partner will send a particular number of people to the receiving
                partner, for a particular average duration each (e.g. for 8 weeks). This
                describes an unidirectional flow - if people are sent in both directions, two
                separate mobility specifications need to be defined (one for each direction).

                More requirements (e.g. *who* is being sent to do *what*) are defined in
                specific `*-mobility-spec` subclasses.

                This type, nor any of its subclasses, SHOULD NOT be referenced outside of the
                EWP IIAs API. It is likely to be modified, or to be removed, in the future.

                        ignore it completely. If the server is aware that particular students should

                        this MAY be the "root" unit (the one representing the entire HEI).

                        These IDs are defined by the HEI referred to in the `sending-hei-id` element.
                        Clients can use Organizational Units API (the one served directly on the
                        sending HEI's servers) to fetch more data on this unit. If the server is
                        not aware of these IDs, then it won't provide them.

                        Not all servers provide these! Many HEIs (especially the smaller ones) don't
                        granulate their contacts in such a detailed way. Instead, they have a fixed set
                        of contacts described in their Institutions API.

                        These contacts take precedence over contacts defined in the Institutions API,
                        and the ones defined in the `contact` elements of *this* API (outside of the
                        cooperation conditions list). Clients are advised to display these contacts in
                        a separate section above other contacts - so that the users will notice them
                        first (before scrolling down to other, more generic contacts).
