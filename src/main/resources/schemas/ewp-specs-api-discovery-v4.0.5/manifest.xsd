            This schema is a part of the Erasmus Without Paper project. Before you start
            using it, make sure you have read the general rules described here:

                EWP Discovery Manifest.

                Defines a single EWP Host - a set of relationships between HEIs, APIs, server
                administrators and client credentials. One EWP Host defines a single Cartesian
                product of all these sets. (E.g. if a client certificate X and a HEI Y are
                present in the same host, then it means that server which signs its requests
                with X is allowed to request resources visible to HEI Y. Similar statement is
                true for every other pair of sets.)

                Most partners will need exactly one manifest. However, in some cases, you might
                need to have more than one. For example, when you server covers two HEIs, but
                one of your APIs is available for only one of these two HEIs, then it's
                impossible to describe such relationship with a single Cartesian product. You
                will need to use a sum of at least two Cartesian products (which is expressed
                by two `host` entries).

                            RECOMMENDED element. Address of a developer or server administrator who may be
                            contacted in case of problems (e.g. invalid Manifest file, invalid certificates,
                            server errors, etc.). Multiple addresses may be provided.

                            Please note, that additional `admin-email` elements can also be included inside
                            specific APIs sections (this allows you to bind extra admins to specific APIs
                            without the need of creating dedicated manifest files).

                            A list of HEIs (Higher Education Institutions) that are covered by this host.

                            In conjunction with `apis-implemented`, enlisting a HEI here indicates that the
                            partner wants to receive specific HEI-related API queries regarding this HEI,
                            and that it will be able to understand them.

                            In conjunction with `client-credentials-in-use`, enlisting a HEI here indicates
                            that these credentials can be used to request resources "in the name of" this
                            HEI.

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the items
                            published here, for example if it believes that this HEI does not *want* to be
                            covered by you. If, for some reason, your items are not being imported, and
                            you're not sure why, please contact the Registry Service maintainers. You can
                            also take a look at this thread:

                            other EWP hosts.

                            You should have this element present if you intend to perform requests within
                            the EWP Network. However, it's worth noting, that not having it is also valid
                            (if you want your EWP Host to be "server only").

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the
                            credentials submitted here, for example if it finds they do not meet proper
                            security standards. If, for some reason, your credentials are not being
                            imported, and you're not sure why, please contact the Registry Service
                            administrators.
