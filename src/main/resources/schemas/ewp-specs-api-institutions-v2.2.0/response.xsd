                                        Optional abbreviation of the HEI's name (usually 2-6 upper case letters, but
                                        there are no strict rules here). If given, then this abbreviation SHOULD be
                                        *unique within the country* of this HEI. It also SHOULD be well recognized,
                                        e.g. the first Google result for query "Poland UW" is "University of Warsaw",
                                        so "UW" is a well-recognized abbreviation of University of Warsaw.

                                        If multiple well-recognized abbreviations exist, then it is advised to use
                                        either the most well-recognized, or the "most international" one of those.

                                        The street address of the institution.

                                        This is the address which should work when, for example, the user pastes it
                                        into Google Maps. If this HEI has many campuses, then this address should refer
                                        to a "main" campus. If this HEI doesn't have a "main" campus, then the address
                                        should simply contain the name of the institution, a city, and a country. In
                                        extreme cases, even a single country entry is better than nothing. Also see

                                        This is the primary address. Note, that more addresses may be provided by using
                                        the "contact" element.

                                        Multiple URLs can be provided (with different xml:lang values). It is also
                                        perfectly okay to provide a single URL which dynamically detects the viewer's
                                        language preferences (in this case, no xml:lang attribute should be given).

                                        If given, this should be a HTTPS URL pointing to the institution's logo.
                                        It does not necessarily have to be hosted on the same domain as the API.

                                        This URL MUST be publicly accessible to all requests made directly from
                                        students' browsers (as opposed to being accessible for EWP requesters only). It
                                        is RECOMMENDED that the server uses proper cache-busting techniques to ensure
                                        efficient propagation of updated content.

                                        Preferably, this should be an SVG, PNG or JPEG file, in "squarish" (~1:1)
                                        dimensions ratio, and a resolution suitable for both display and printing, on
                                        white or transparent background, with no margins included (clients are advised
                                        to add proper margins before the logo is displayed).

                                        See resources/logo-examples directory for some examples of valid logos. You
                                        will find it in the Institutions API specs page:

                                        This URL is the most important one for the incoming students (much more
                                        important than website-url above). Server developers SHOULD provide it (and
                                        keep it updated).

                                        This URL MUST be publicly accessible to all requests made directly from
                                        students' browsers (as opposed to being accessible for EWP requesters only). It

                                        efficient propagation of updated content.

                                        It SHOULD refer to either a PDF file, or a HTML website, or both (via two
                                        separate factsheet-url elements). Other formats are also permitted, but
                                        discouraged (discuss here:
                                        https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-api-institutions/issues/3).
                                        The document should contain all information the incoming student should know
                                        before he applies for the mobility on this HEI. (Note, that this information is
                                        NOT connected to any specific IIAs - this is an introductory document and its
                                        scope is very broad; it is designed to be of use to *any* incoming student.)

                                        Elements SHOULD have an xml:lang attribute, and at least one URL should refer
                                        to a factsheet written in English.

                                        A list of important contacts - phones, emails, addresses.

                                        In context of EWP, this will most often be mobility-related contacts, but it's
                                        not a rule. This means that server developers MAY choose to include all other
                                        kinds of contacts here (such as, for example, the phone number and address of
                                        the Institution's Library). Such contacts SHOULD however come AFTER the "more
                                        important" ones.

                                        information on the purpose and format of this element.

                                        If this HEI implements Organizational Units API in a tree-like format, then
                                        this element should contain the ID of the root unit (the unit which represents
                                        the entire institution).

                                        Note that it is NOT required to expose units as a tree-like structure. Clients
                                        MUST be able to handle both cases (e.g. convert flat list of units into a
                                        "fake" tree).

                                        A list of IDs of all significant organizational units. Clients can fetch more
                                        information on these via the Organizational Units API.

                                        If this HEI implements Organizational Units API in a tree-like format, then
                                        this list should contain IDs of all *exposed* nodes in the tree (including the
                                        root node).

                                        It is not required to expose all units. Servers may choose which units are
                                        relevant for EWP data exchange (and, in fact, they often SHOULD limit what they
                                        expose, to avoid clutter in client user interfaces).
