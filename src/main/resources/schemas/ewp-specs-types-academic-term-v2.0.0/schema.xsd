            using it, make sure you have read the general rules described here:

                A global identifier of an academic year.

                On northern hemisphere, academic years start in September, and every academic
                year can be identified by a string of the "2010/2011" form (where
                this first integer is always equal to the first *plus one*).

                On southern hemisphere, academic years typically start in January, and such
                academic years will be identified by a string of the "2010/2010" (where the
                second integer equals the first).

                At the beginning of the EWP project clients MAY expect all academic years to
                come in the northern hemisphere format.

                Experimental identifier scheme which aims at uniquely identifying academic
                terms. It is experimental because we are not 100% sure if *all* possible
                academic terms used throughout the world can be uniquely identified by this
                identifier. We are however quite sure that *most* can (the regular ones -
                semesters, trimesters etc.). Discuss here:
                https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-types-academic-term/issues/1


                Naming guidelines
                -----------------

                Please note, that many institutions will use other kinds of identifiers for
                their academic terms, and we don't want any unnecessary confusion here. For
                this reason, if you decide to use this format (both within and outside of EWP),
                then:

                * Please refer to it as "EWP unique academic term identifier", or simply
                  "EWP identifier" (when used within the context of a specific academic term).
                * Avoid referring to it by "academic term identifier" (because it may be vague
                  without the EWP specifier).
                * If possible, please add a reference pointing the reader to the original EWP
                  specifications of the EwpAcademicTermId data type (e.g. by importing
                  EwpAcademicTermId in your XSD, or adding a link to the GitHub repository in
                  your JavaDocs, etc.)


                Specification
                -------------

                EWP academic terms identifiers have the form of the following string:

                AcademicYearId-TermNumber/NumberOfTerms

                where:

                - AcademicYearId is the identifier of the academic year which this academic
                  term is part of. The format of this identifier is described in the
                  AcademicYearId simpleType (e.g. "2008/2009" or "2008/2008").

                - NumberOfTerms identifies the *type* of this academic term. It does so by
                  indicating the total number of academic terms of this type which occur within
                  a single academic year. For example: "2" means a semester, because there are
                  2 semesters within a single academic year.

                - TermNumber MUST be less or equal to NumberOfTerms, and it indicates the
                  number of this particular academic term (within this academic year).

                Both TermNumber and NumberOfTerms are integers. In practice, we don't think
                they will ever reach a number greater than 4, but currently this format allows
                them to be integers between 1 and 9.


                Examples
                --------

                - "2008/2009-1/1" - the whole academic year 2008/2009,
                - "2008/2009-1/2" - the first semester of this academic year (autumn semester),
                - "2008/2009-2/2" - the second semester of this academic year (spring semester),
                - "2008/2009-1/3" - the first trimester of this academic year,
                - etc.

                Note, that these identifiers also work on the southern hemisphere, though a bit
                differently:

                - "2008/2008-1/1" - the whole academic year 2008,
                - "2008/2008-1/2" - the first semester of this academic year (spring semester),
                - "2008/2008-2/2" - the first semester of this academic year (autumn semester),
                - "2008/2008-1/4" - the first quadrimester of this academic year,
                - etc.
