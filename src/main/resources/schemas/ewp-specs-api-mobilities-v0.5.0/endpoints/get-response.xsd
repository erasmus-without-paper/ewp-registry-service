                                        The "before mobility" and "latest approved" sections are optional. It is allowed
                                        to have only the "latest draft" section (this indicates that no LA has yet been
                                        approved).

                                        However, if "before mobility" section exists, then we also require "latest
                                        approved" section to exist. In many cases, `latest-approved-changes` will be
                                        empty, and `latest-approved-snapshot` will contain the exact contents as the
                                        `before-mobility-snapshot` does. It might seem redundant, but we require it for
                                        completeness (to make sure all partners understand what "latest approved"
                                        means).

                                            equivalent of "Table C"). You can discuss it here:

                            We need different versions of this list because the EUC LA template (attached in
                            this XSD's repository) requires it.

                            PLEASE READ THE ANNOTATIONS ON THE `components-studied` ELEMENT. The
                            `components-recognized` element has the same base format as the
                            `components-studied` element does, and so, **we are not describing this format
                            here again**. The only difference is that other types of entities are described
                            by it - in EUC LA template, these entities are described by tables "B" and
                            "B2" (while `components-studied` describe tables "A" and "A2").

                            Note, that very few servers are planning to provide this feature at the initial
                            stages of EWP adoption:

                            they're trying to identify the component, but it does not necessarilly contain
                            a valid EWP's LOS ID used in the Courses API.

                            In case of many HEIs, it will be equal to the LOS ID provided above, but it's
                            purpose is entirely different. LOS IDs are surrogate identifiers (and, as such,
                            should not be displayed to the user), while LOS codes are "human readable", but
                            don't they are *not used* to identify entities in EWP network.

                            Component title at the receiving institution. This field MAY be entered "by
                            hand" (for example by the student), especially if no `los-id` is given. It
                            might assist other users (and/or computer systems) when they're trying to
                            identify the component, but it does not necessarilly match the name exactly.

                            Note, that this field does not contain an `xml:lang` attribute, and it can be
                            provided only once (preferably in English). If clients want to retrieve titles
                            in other languages, then they can do this via the Courses API.

                            If it so happens that a component changes its name (on the receiving HEI's
                            servers), then it is the *receiving HEI* that SHOULD update all the titles of
                            the matching LOSes in all remote mobilities (of course, the *sending* HEI MAY
                            fix such inconsistencies too, if it somehow notices that a title has been
                            changed).

                                    Servers are NOT REQUIRED to store this information. For example, some HEIs
                                    might get their student approvals on paper (instead of allowing the students to
                                    approve them online). Such HEIs will put the "approved by the student" label on
                                    the snapshot automatically, immediatelly after the snapshot gets approved by
                                    the sending coordinator (aka `sending-hei` party). In such cases, the actual
                                    date of student's approval is not stored in the system, but the HEI "vouches"
                                    that such approval took place.

                        approved by the parties provided here.

                        There are numerous ways in which the sending HEIs might want the process of
                        draft approval to proceed. This element allows these HEIs suggest the order of
                        approvals they prefer. Some HEIs might even *reject* approvals unless a proper
                        `should-now-be-approved-by` is in place. Please discuss here:
                        https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-api-mobilities/issues/16

                        The presence of this element MAY trigger some special behavior in the client
                        UIs. For example, the mobilities waiting for user's approval can be highlighted
                        for this user when he's browsing through the list of mobilities. Or, perhaps,
                        the user might even receive an email notification.

                        This element MUST NOT refer to parties which have already approved this
                        snapshot (so, in effect, it can only be used in the `latest-draft-snapshot`
                        element). It also MUST NOT be used if the snapshot doesn't contain any changes

                                    A human-readable description of the reason - preferrably in English. It will
                                    often be printed in PDF LA document (e.g. in the "Reason for change" column of
                                    A2 or B2 table - see attached EUC LA template).

                                    The value of this element can sometimes be inferred from `ewp-reason-code`, but
                                    for forward-compatibility reasons, this element is required regardless of this
                                    fact.

                                    If the reason cannot be provided, server implementers MAY provide an empty
                                    string here. This is NOT RECOMMENDED though. Users SHOULD give some reason for
                                    each of their changes, and the server SHOULD store these reasons.

                                    An optional reason code. It is RECOMMENDED to provide it, if the reason for
                                    change matches one of the reasons provided in the enumeration below. If no
                                    match can be found, then this element MUST NOT be provided.

                                    Currently, the enumeration supports viable reasons for changing
                                    `components-studied` list only. This element MUST NOT be provided for
                                    changes in `components-recognized`.

                                    Attached EUC LA template defines seven "Reasons for exceptional changes to
                                    study programme abroad", and assigns them numbers from 1 to 7. EUC does say
                                    whether this assignment is backward-compatible or not, so we must assume it
                                    isn't. Therefore, we introduce an enumeration of our own, which is intended to
                                    stay backward-compatible.

                                    IMPORTANT: New values MAY be added to this enumeration in future releases of
                                    this API, and such expansion is considered backward-compatible. Clients MUST be
                                    aware of this fact - if you find an unknown value here, you MUST treat it the
                                    same way as if no `ewp-reason-code` was given at all. Server MUST NOT expand
                                    their set of used reason codes without consulting EWP Partners - new reason
                                    codes MUST be added to the enumeration before they can be used.

                                                This one is NOT defined by EUC, but it seemed reasonable to add it here. It can
                                                be used with both "delete" and "insert" changes, and it indicates an update in
                                                the component properties - like a change in the component's name (e.g. a
                                                spelling error), or the number of awarded ECTS points. The exact reason for the
                                                change SHOULD be specified in the `display-text` element.

                                                This reason MUST NOT be provided if the component is *actually* being removed
                                                or added. It is used *only* when an *existing* component is *updated* (which is
                                                represented as two changes - a "delete" and an "insert" - preferably in this
                                                order, next to each other).

                                                It's worth noting that some servers MAY also choose to "rewrite history"
                                                in case of unimportant mistakes, like obvious spelling errors in component name.
                                                Such "rewrite" will cause a component to instantly change its name in all
                                                snapshots (even those snapshots which have been approved a long time ago).
