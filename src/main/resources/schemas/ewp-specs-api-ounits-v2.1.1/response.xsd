                This describes the format of the response returned by the EWP Organizational
                Units API.

                        <xs:documentation>
                            This represents a single organizational unit (this can be faculty, department,
                            division, or the whole "root" institution). Servers will produce one such
                            element for each existing organizational unit matching any of the `ounit_id`
                            or `ounit_code` values passed in the Organizational Units API call.

                            Note that it is NOT required to expose units as a tree-like structure, and it
                            is NOT required for a root unit to exist. Clients MUST be able to handle both
                            cases (e.g. convert flat list of units into a "fake" tree). However, *if*
                            servers choose to expose their units in a tree-like format, then the root unit
                            MUST exist (this is how clients will detect which format is used), and it must
                            have the ID as given in the `root-ounit-id` element in the Institutions API.

                            It is not required to expose all units. Servers may choose which units are
                            relevant for EWP data exchange (and, in fact, they often SHOULD limit what they
                            expose, to avoid clutter in client user interfaces).

                                        Unique identifier of this organizational unit. It SHOULD NOT be displayed to
                                        the user (use `ounit-code` for that).

                                        Server implementers MUST use immutable surrogate keys for their work with EWP.

                                        Since `ounit-id` values should contain surrogate identifiers (and, as such,
                                        should not be displayed to the user), we allow additional "human readable"
                                        unique codes (aka "natural identifiers") to be provided here. These codes MAY
                                        be displayed to the user along the unit name, and they MAY be used for
                                        searching, but they are *not used* to identify entities in EWP network.

                                        Optional abbreviation of the unit's name (usually 2-6 upper case letters, but
                                        there are no strict rules here). If given, then this abbreviation SHOULD be
                                        *unique within the HEI* of this unit. It also SHOULD be well recognized,
                                        e.g. the first Google result for query "University of Warsaw MIM" brings us to
                                        "Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics", so "MIM" is a
                                        well-recognized abbreviation of this particular organizational unit.

                                        If multiple well-recognized abbreviations exist, then it is advised to use
                                        either the most well-recognized, or the "most international" one of those.

                                        Optional parent unit ID.

                                        Many computer systems keep units in a tree-like hierarchy. The client is not
                                        required to display these hierarchy as such, but it can, if it wants to (and if
                                        this information is provided by the server implementers).

                                        When this feature is served, server implementers SHOULD make sure that all
                                        units form a valid tree, with a single root unit. The root unit should
                                        represent the HEI itself. All units in this tree (including the root unit)
                                        should be referenced in the Institutions API response (via the the ounit-id
                                        elements).

                                        Street address of this organizational unit.

                                        This is the address which should work when, for example, the user pastes it
                                        into Google Maps. If this organizational unit is spread between multiple
                                        addresses, then this address should refer to a "primary" building. If it
                                        doesn't have a "primary" building, then the address should be skipped
                                        (multiple addresses can still be provided via separate "contact" elements).

                                        This is the primary address. Note, that more addresses may be provided by using

                                        This is similar to the `mobility-factsheet-url` element in the Institutions API,

                                        this particular Organizational Unit only.

                                        As was the case in the Institutions API, it SHOULD refer to either a PDF file,
                                        or a HTML website, or both (via two separate factsheet-url elements). Other
                                        formats are also permitted, but discouraged.

                                        Elements SHOULD have an xml:lang attribute, and at least one URL should refer
                                        to a factsheet written in English.
