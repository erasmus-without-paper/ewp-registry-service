                Manifest files describe a set of EWP Hosts. Manifest files are usually read by
                the EWP Registry Service only.

                            A list of HEIs (Higher Education Institutions) that are covered by this host.
                            **As of version 5.1.0 this list MUST consist of no more than one HEI**.

                            In conjunction with `apis-implemented`, enlisting a HEI here indicates that the
                            partner wants to receive specific HEI-related API queries regarding this HEI,
                            and that it will be able to understand them.

                            In conjunction with `client-credentials-in-use`, enlisting a HEI here indicates
                            that these credentials can be used to request resources "in the name of" this
                            HEI.

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the items
                            published here, for example if it believes that this HEI does not *want* to be
                            covered by you. If, for some reason, your items are not being imported, and
                            you're not sure why, please contact the Registry Service maintainers. You can
                            also take a look at this thread:

                            The list of client credentials used by this host to make requests to
                            other EWP hosts.

                            You should have this element present if you intend to perform requests within
                            the EWP Network. However, it's worth noting, that not having it is also valid
                            (if you want your EWP Host to be "server only").

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the
                            credentials submitted here, for example if it finds they do not meet proper
                            security standards. If, for some reason, your credentials are not being

                            The list of server credentials used by this host to authenticate its servers
                            when communicating to other EWP hosts. Note, that only *some* methods of server
                            authentication make use of these credentials.

                            As opposed to client authentication, the keys used in server authentication are
                            bound to specific endpoints (URLs).
                            This means that - if you create multiple manifests - then each of your
                            endpoints MAY use a different key for signing its responses. However, in most
                            cases, you will want to use only a single key for all your APIs and endpoints.

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the
                            credentials submitted here, for example if it finds they do not meet proper
                            security standards. If, for some reason, your credentials are not being
