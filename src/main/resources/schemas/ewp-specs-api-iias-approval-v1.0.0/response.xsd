                            This element represents a single IIA approval. 
                            For each of the `iia_id` values passed in the API call, server will produce one such
                            element if and only if the corresponding agreement
                            (more precisely: partner's copy of the agreement) is approved by him.

                                <xs:annotation>
                                    <xs:documentation>
                                        The SHA-256 digest of the cooperation-conditions element of the agreement that is
                                        being approved but *excluding* `sending-contact` and `receiving-contact` subelements.
                                        Before calculating the hash, the cooperation-conditions element
                                        should be normalized using Exclusive XML Canonicalization.

                                        The digest is present in the IIAs API get response, but MUST be verified by the server
                                        before sending the approval. For this purpose, the server has to call the IIAs get API
                                        and compare the hash received in the response with the hash independently calculated
                                        from the cooperation conditions received in that response. If both hashes are identical,
                                        the agreement can be approved. Hash MUST NOT be calculated from the cooperation conditions
                                        of the server's local version of the agreement.

                                        Note: Server does not perform above mentioned hash verification as a result of
                                        IIAs Approval get request. It MUST be done before and stored locally on the server
                                        (and announced with CNR).

                                        PDF version of the agreement. This SHOULD be the PDF that was
                                        fetched from the partner via the Interinstitutional Agreements API, additionally
                                        signed by the approving partner.
                                        
                                        This element SHOULD be skipped if the `send_pdf` request parameter value is `false`.

                                        Notes for client implementers:

                                        The pdf element can be missing even if the `send_pdf` parameter was set to true.
                                        Some servers MAY not support PDFs at all or the signed PDF version can be not ready yet.

                                        For security reasons, you may consider checking the content type of the file
                                        before displaying it in the browser.
