            This schema is a part of the Erasmus Without Paper project. Before you start
            using it, make sure you have read the general rules described here:

    <xs:element name="manifest">
        <xs:annotation>
            <xs:documentation>
                EWP Discovery Manifest.

                Manifest files are published by EWP Partners and help define relationships
                between EWP Hosts, their developers, clients, HEIs and API Servers.

                Manifest files are usually read by the EWP Registry Service only.

                            RECOMMENDED element. Address of a developer or server administrator who may be
                            contacted in case of problems (e.g. invalid Manifest file, invalid certificates,
                            server errors, etc.). Multiple addresses may be provided.

                            Please note, that additional `admin-email` elements can also be included inside
                            specific APIs sections.

                            host for Registry maintainers and client developers. Must be provided in English.

                            E.g. "This host is a DEMO server. We plan to keep it online for testing.".

                        <xs:documentation>
                            A list of HEIs (Higher Education Institutions) that are covered by this host.

                            Enlisting an institution here indicates that the host wants to receive queries
                            regarding this institution and will be able to understand them. If this list is
                            empty then the host is likely to not receive any queries at all.

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the items
                            submitted here, for example if it finds that some institutions are already
                            covered by a different EWP Host. If, for some reason, your items are not being
                            imported, and you're not sure why, please contact the Registry Service
                            maintainers.

                        <xs:documentation>
                            The list of client credentials used by this host to make requests to
                            other EWP hosts.

                            You should have this element present if you intend to perform requests within
                            the EWP Network. However, it's worth noting, that not having it is also valid
                            (if you want your EWP Host to be "server only").

                            Be advised, that the Registry Service MAY ignore some (or all) of the
                            credentials submitted here, for example if it finds they do not meet proper
                            security standards. If, for some reason, your credentials are not being
                            imported, and you're not sure why, please contact the Registry Service
                            administrators.

                                    <xs:documentation>
                                        Base64-encoded X.509 certificate. This MAY be a self-signed certificate.

                                        Having self-signed certificates installed in developers' browsers might make
                                        development and debugging significantly easier (it will allow developers to
                                        make EWP requests directly in their browsers). However, it is NOT RECOMMENDED
                                        to use them in production environment.

                                        IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE: If your private key is compromised, you MUST
                                        immediately remove all certificates based on this key from your manifest.
