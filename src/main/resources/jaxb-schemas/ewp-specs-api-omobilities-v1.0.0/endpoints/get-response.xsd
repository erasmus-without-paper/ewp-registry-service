                    This describes a single Student Mobility for Studies.

                    In the future, it may become a "subclass" of a more generic Mobility parent class
                    (and some of the fields might be moved to the parent).

                    Immutable elements
                    ------------------

                    Every mobility has its unique sending-hei, receiving-hei and nominee, which
                    MUST NOT change after the mobility is created. For example, if it turns out
                    that a different student will be nominated for this mobility, then a new
                    omobility-id MUST be created for such nomination. However, the properties of
                    these mobility-related entities still MAY change. E.g. the student's name may
                    get updated.

                            Most mobilities take place (or are supposed to take place) during a single
                            academic term (or part of such single term). The sending HEI is REQUIRED to
                            either identify this term, or to clearly state that the sending mobility period
                            is "non-standard", and is not contained by any single academic term.

                            This information needs to be provided "from the start" (when a new nomination is
                            created). It is different than the information provided in the
                            `planned-arrival-date` and `planned-departure-date` elements (which may be
                            provided at later date).

                            For more information, read this thread:
                            https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-types-academic-term/issues/2

                                If this element is present, then the sending HEI states that the mobility is
                                supposed to take place *during* the academic term identified here.

                                "During" doesn't imply that it will take place over the *entire* period of the
                                academic term. However, it's also RECOMMENDED to supply the *smallest* academic
                                term within which the mobility period fits into (i.e. the use of an academic
                                year should be avoided if a semester is sufficient). See here:
                                https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-api-omobilities/pull/30#discussion_r159843983

                                Note, that sending and receiving HEIs MAY use different academic term
                                identifiers (e.g. "2010/2011-1/2" might be equal to "2010/2010-2/2"). This
                                particular identifier is the term identifier at the *sending* HEI, not the
                                receiving HEI.

                                If this element is present, then the sending HEI states that the mobility is
                                supposed to take place outside the bounds of any standard academic term. E.g.
                                during the summer vacations.

                                This element is currently empty, but this MAY change in the future. Clients
                                MUST be ready for that (and treat such non-empty element as if it was empty).

                            Academic year during which this mobility takes place (or is supposed to take
                            place).

                            Note, that sending and receiving HEIs MAY use different academic year
                            identifiers (e.g. "2010/2011" vs. "2010/2010" or "2011/2011"). This
                            particular identifier is the year identifier at the *receiving* HEI, not the
                            sending HEI.

                            This means that the sending HEI MUST know how the receiving HEI identifies its
                            academic years (i.e. whether it lies on the northern or southern hemisphere),
                            and be able to match its mobilities with these identifiers.

                                        * Whenever possible, the server SHOULD provide an up-to-date photo in a

                                          to be used for a student card. Such photo SHOULD come first in this list.

                                        * Other photos in many aspect ratios may follow. They may be variations of the
                                          same photo (e.g. without cropping, or with a different cropping), or they may

                                          that such URLs may expire at any moment. If the clients need to have a copy
                                          of the photo, then they MUST copy the contents of the photo to their servers.

                            we are interested in the EQF level the student **will have** when the mobility
                            actually begins (according to many IROs this is more important than the one the
                            students has at the time of the nomination).

                            Server implementers are encouraged to supply both values. If it is not
