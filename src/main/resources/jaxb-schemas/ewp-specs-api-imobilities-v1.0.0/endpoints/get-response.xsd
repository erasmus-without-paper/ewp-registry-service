                    This describes the "incoming part" of a single Student Mobility for Studies.
                    "Incoming part" is the set of mobility's properties which the *receiving* HEI
                    is the master of.

                    In the future, it may become a "subclass" of a more generic Mobility parent class
                    (and some of the fields might be moved to the parent).

                            An optional comment. It is RECOMMENDED for comments to be provided only when
                            necessary (e.g. when nominations are rejected, student did not appear on receiving HEI
                            or leaved unexpectedly).
                            These comments MUST be visible only to the IRO members, not the students.

                            Note, that this API allows for every mobility to have a different
                            comment. However, it is also okay for the clients to simply "batch copy" a single comment to all
                            mobilities being rejected.

                            It is left unspecified how servers should handle these comments - e.g.
                            they may store them along their mobilities, or they may forward them to specific persons, etc.
