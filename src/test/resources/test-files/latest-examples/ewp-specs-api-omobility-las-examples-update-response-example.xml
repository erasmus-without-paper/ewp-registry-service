    In this particular example, the message is the response to a successful
    `approve-components-studied-draft-v1` update request.

    As noted in XSD, this message is optional. It's perfectly okay for the server
    to now supply it. However, if the server supplies it, then the client SHOULD
    display it to its user (if possible).
    -->
    <ewp:success-user-message>Thank you. University of Warsaw's servers had successfully received your approval.</ewp:success-user-message>
