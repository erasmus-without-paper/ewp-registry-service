### NOTICE: Check if our client credentials have been served long enough.

Our client credentials are quite fresh. This means that many Echo APIs will (correctly) return error responses in places where we expect HTTP 200. This notice will disappear once our credentials are 10 minutes old.


### SUCCESS: Verifying the format of the URL. Expecting a valid HTTPS-scheme URL.
### SUCCESS: Verifying if the URL is properly registered.

### ERROR: Querying for supported security methods. Validating http-security integrity.

Errors:
- Your Echo API does not support ANY of the client authentication methods recognized by the Validator.

Warnings:
- It is RECOMMENDED for all EWP server endpoints to support HTTP Signature Client Authentication. Your endpoint doesn't.

- It is RECOMMENDED for all servers to support HTTP Signature Server Authentication.
