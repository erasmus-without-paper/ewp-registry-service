### NOTICE: Check if our client credentials have been served long enough.

Our client credentials are quite fresh. This means that many Echo APIs will (correctly) return error responses in places where we expect HTTP 200. This notice will disappear once our credentials are 10 minutes old.


### SUCCESS: Verifying the format of the URL. Expecting a valid HTTPS-scheme URL.

### WARNING: Verifying if the URL is properly registered.

Version 1 of Echo API is deprecated. You should implement Version 2 instead.


### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[GATTT] (no client authentication). Expecting a valid HTTP 401 or HTTP 403 error response.
### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[PATTT] (no client authentication). Expecting a valid HTTP 401 or HTTP 403 error response.
### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[GSTTT] with an unknown TLS client certificate (a random one, that has never been published in the Registry). Expecting to receive a valid HTTP 401 or HTTP 403 error response.
### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[GSTTT] GET request with a list of echo values [a, b, a]. Expecting to receive a valid HTTP 200 Echo API response, with proper hei-id and matching echo values.
### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[PSTTT] with an unknown TLS client certificate (a random one, that has never been published in the Registry). Expecting to receive a valid HTTP 401 or HTTP 403 error response.
### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[-STTT] with a PUT request. Expecting to receive a valid HTTP 405 error response.
### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[-STTT] with a DELETE request. Expecting to receive a valid HTTP 405 error response.
### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[PSTTT] POST request with a list of echo values [a, b, a]. Expecting to receive a valid HTTP 200 Echo API response, with proper hei-id and matching echo values.
### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[PSTTT] POST request with a list of echo values [a, b, a], plus an additional GET echo=c&echo=c parameters. Expecting the GET parameters to be ignored. (It's a POST request, so all parameters are passed via POST body.)

### NOTICE: Trying Combination[PSTTT] with additional "gzip" added in Accept-Encoding. Expecting the same response, but preferably gzipped.

The client explicitly accepted gzip, but the server didn't compress its response. That's not an error, but it might be useful to support gzip encoding to save bandwidth.
