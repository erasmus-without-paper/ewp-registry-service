### NOTICE: Check if our client credentials have been served long enough.

Our client credentials are quite fresh. This means that many Echo APIs will (correctly) return error responses in places where we expect HTTP 200. This notice will disappear once our credentials are 10 minutes old.


### SUCCESS: Verifying the format of the URL. Expecting a valid HTTPS-scheme URL.
### SUCCESS: Verifying if the URL is properly registered.
