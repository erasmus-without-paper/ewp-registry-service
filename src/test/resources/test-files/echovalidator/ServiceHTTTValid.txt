### NOTICE: Check if our client credentials have been served long enough.

Our client credentials are quite fresh. This means that many APIs will (correctly) return error responses in places where we expect HTTP 200. This notice will disappear once our credentials are 10 minutes old.


### SUCCESS: Verifying the format of the URL. Expecting a valid HTTPS-scheme URL.
### SUCCESS: Verifying if the URL is properly registered.

### NOTICE: Querying for supported security methods. Validating http-security integrity.

Notices:
- It is RECOMMENDED for all servers to support HTTP Signature Server Authentication.

### SUCCESS: Trying Combination[PHTTT] POST request with a list of echo values [a, b, a], plus an additional GET echo=c&echo=c parameters. Expecting the GET parameters to be ignored. (It's a POST request, so all parameters are passed via POST body.)

### NOTICE: Trying Combination[PHTTT] with additional "gzip" added in Accept-Encoding. Expecting the same response, but preferably gzipped.

The client explicitly accepted gzip, but the server didn't compress its response. That's not an error, but it might be useful to support gzip encoding to save bandwidth.
