### NOTICE: Check if our client credentials have been served long enough.

Our client credentials are quite fresh. This means that many Echo APIs will (correctly) return error responses in places where we expect HTTP 200. This notice will disappear once our credentials are 10 minutes old.


### SUCCESS: Verifying the format of the URL. Expecting a valid HTTPS-scheme URL.

### WARNING: Verifying if the URL is properly registered.

Version 1.0.0 of the API is deprecated. You should implement new version.

### FAILURE: Trying Combination[GSTTT] GET request with a list of echo values [a, b, a]. Expecting to receive a valid HTTP 200 Echo API response, with proper hei-id and matching echo values.

The response has proper HTTP status and it passed the schema validation. However, the set of returned hei-ids doesn't match what we expect. It should contain the following: [hei01.developers.erasmuswithoutpaper.eu, hei02.developers.erasmuswithoutpaper.eu]
